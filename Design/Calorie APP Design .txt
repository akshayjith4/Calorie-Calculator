Calorie APP Design 

What’s the average necessary daily calorie intake?
The concept of a calorie is grounded in tangible science: One calorie equals the energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius.

Caloric needs can vary significantly from person to person, depending on various factors. These factors include your gender-assigned-at-birth, age, height, and overall lifestyle.

Generally speaking, adults require approximately 1,600 to 3,000 Calories per day.

Consuming more calories than your body expends leads to weight gain, while consuming fewer calories than your body expends in weight loss—including fat and eventually muscle mass.


What factors affect how many calories you need per day?
1. Age
2. Height and weight
3. Gender and hormones
4. Activity level
5. Medical conditions and medications
6. Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
7. Goals


TDEE: Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure

Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) is the comprehensive sum of energy your body expends in a single day.
These components add up to your TDEE:

1.Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)
  Your BMR reflects the calories your body consumes while performing essential functions at rest. This constitutes roughly 70 percent of your TDEE and encompasses activities like breathing, circulating blood, and supporting brain function.	
2.Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)
  TEF denotes the energy needed to digest, absorb, and metabolize the foods you consume. Around 10 percent of your TDEE stems from TEF, but this can vary based on your diet. Foods high in protein or complex carbs require more energy for processing, boosting TEF.
3.Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (EAT)
  EAT contributes a small portion, approximately 5 percent, to your TDEE. It includes the calories burned during intentional exercise like hitting the gym, jogging, or yoga.
4.Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)
  NEAT accounts for the remaining 15 percent of your TDEE. It includes the energy expended during your daily non-exercise activities, such as walking, fidgeting, and household chores.

  Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:
For men:
BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A + 5
For women:
BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A - 161
Revised Harris-Benedict Equation:
For men:
BMR = 13.397W + 4.799H - 5.677A + 88.362
For women:
BMR = 9.247W + 3.098H - 4.330A + 447.593
Katch-McArdle Formula:
BMR = 370 + 21.6(1 - F)W
where:
W is body weight in kg
H is body height in cm
A is age
F is body fat in percentage
